# Fastro

Fastro is an editorial website blueprint built to help teams launch content-driven experiences quickly while keeping room to grow. It pairs the flexibility of Astro with an editor-friendly workflow so writers, designers, and developers can collaborate without friction.

This project is heavily inspired and copied from Head-Start, a boilerplate created by the NL agency VoorHoede. Their version is undoubtedly more extended and powerful, incorporating numerous well-reasoned best practices. However, for my purpose, that’s excessive, so Fastro aims to obtain only some inspiration.

## Why Fastro

- Start from a clear content architecture, ready for multi-language storytelling.
- Reuse thoughtfully named blocks and helpers so pages stay consistent.
- Keep documentation close to the code base, making it easy for new teammates to join.
